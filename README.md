## Jetpack Inspect

A debugging tool to help you monitor, edit and send requests from your WordPress site.

## To Do

There are still quite a few things left to do:

- The plugin is currently insecure - no nonces are used.
- Pull in Jetpack Connection package into the plugin to make it standalone.
- Make editing JSON easier, either with a JSON editor or a in-browser code-editor library.
- Add an option to monitor only admin, only front-end, or both.
- The UI still needs some work.
- Embed the form in each list item instead of using only the one form at the top.
- Add error handling when WordPress errors are received and network request wasn't even issued.
