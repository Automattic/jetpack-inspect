## Jetpack Inspect

A debugging tool to help you monitor, edit and send requests from your WordPress site.

## To Do

There are still quite a few things left to do:

- The plugin is currently insecure - no nonces are used.
- Pull in Jetpack Connection package into the plugin to make it standalone.
- Populate this readme with useful documentation about the plugin, setup, deploy, etc.
